# 2kW BLDC Motor Driver

This project was created for Teknofest - Efficiency Challenge Competition

This repository consists of two part. First is the motor dirver firmware
and second is the KiCAD design. In firmware development, I've used VS Code
and PlatformIO plugin. PCB design is based on STM32F44RE microcontroller
so that the firmware was written with STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
library. KiCAD design includes both schematic and PCB layout so that it 
can be used directly.
